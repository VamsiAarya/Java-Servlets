How web works?
client (browser) send request to the server and server sends a response
for that request. That is rendered by client.

So what if our app response should be dynamic, user centric?
To tackle that problem we have servlets. Java servlet is a java program,
which takes inputs from request and process that req and prepares a html file
and sends that file as response.

It's is like a helper application.
This servlet resides in a web container. Eg: Tomcat.
To make our web pages dynamic then we need to install Tomcat server and use
servlets in application.

Tomcat server:
1. Contains servlets for various purposes.
2. Contains a Deployment descriptor web.xml which tells which server to be used for 
specific requests
3.  web.xml has 2 tags 
    a) servlet tag
    b) servlet mapping tag

servlet creation:
a. It is a user defined class which extends httpServlet.
b. response can be in html/ xml /json format goes to client in format of response object.
c. For servlet mapping we no more need to use xml, we have annotations as  alternative.
