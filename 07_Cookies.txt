a. cookies are like tokens that remember our Request.
b. For example we went to a shop and asked for an item which costs 50rs but u don't have 50rs exactly
    so u gave 100rs. Neither did the shop owner has 50rs to give you as balance amount. So, he says wait for 5 mins.
c. Now after 5 mins u went and asked him , but he forgot. Instead he gave a token on which he wrote 50rs and asked to show when u come back.
d. This token is called as cookie.
